This helps indicate how sensitive the consumer is to the effect of an increase in interest rates on their repayment obligations (e.g. as a result of the end of a ‘honeymoon’ interest rate period) or a requirement to make a balloon payment at the end of a contract;\n(b) the source of the consumer’s income (including whether all or part of the consumer’s gross income is sourced from payments under the Social Security Act 1991);\n(c) how consistent and reliable the consumer’s income is (and the size of the payment obligations relative to their income level);\n(d) whether the consumer’s expenses are likely to be significantly higher than average (e.g. because they live in a remote area);\n(e) the consumer’s other debt repayment obligations and similar commitments (e.g. child support); and\n(f) whether the consumer is likely to have to sell their assets, such as a car, to meet their payment obligations.\nNote 1: This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of potentially relevant factors.
