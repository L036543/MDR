The purpose of the loan may be to finance a property for owner-occupation in the short-term, but if it will be converted to an investment property, an interest-only home loan will allow maximisation of future taxation benefits.\n(b) Flexible repayments - Consumers may require or desire flexibility with their repayments, and some may wish to make periodic lump sum payments on the home loan due to:\n(i) variable or unpredictable income arrangements, including casual work, self-employment, overtime arrangements, commissions and bonus payments;\n(ii) a temporary reduction in income or cash flow; or\n(iii) moving, furnishing or establishment costs in the early stages of their house purchase.\n(c) Redirect cash flow- Consumers may desire to use surplus funds for other purposes, including:\n(i) non-recurring expenses;\n(ii) discretionary expenditure, such as a holiday or new car; and\n(iii) other investments.\n(d) Temporary finance - Consumers may use an interest-only home loan as bridging finance or a construction loan while their property is built. The loan may be used as a bridging loan with the intention of selling another property and then paying down the loan. With a construction loan, the intention is usually to convert to making principal-and-interest repayments once the construction is completed.\nIn some cases, consumers may prefer to hold surplus funds in an offset account, which reduces the interest payable but remains accessible and can be applied to other purposes.","AKA":"ASIC445.Para109","Enacted":"2014-Sep-27","Regulator":"ASIC","Code":"ASIC445","CellSize":"100.000000000000","YearEnacted":"2014","SubHeading":"ASIC445"},{"Rank 2015":10.0,"Rank 2014":67.0,"Company":"ASIC445.Para110","Country":"Australia","Market value $m":"724 773,1","Heading":"ASIC445","Turnover $m":"123 456,7","Net income $m":"123 456,7","Total assets $m":"724 773,1","Employees":"12 365","Price $":"123,4","Year End":"2014-09-27","Level1":"ASIC445","RegID":"ASIC445.Para110","Description":"Interest-only home loans may be particularly appealing to investors, allowing them to minimise repayments in the short term, while the property value hopefully grows in the longer term.

For example, the decision to take out an interest-only home loan may be influenced by:\n(a) present bias, which causes people to value and focus on immediate or ‘present’ features and costs over less immediate features and costs. This means that a consumer may prefer to make a lower repayment now, even though it will cost them more in the long run; and\n(b) optimism and overconfidence bias, which can cause people to underestimate the likelihood of future negative events and overestimate their own abilities. For example, consumers may:\n(i) fail to properly account for income shocks that may affect repayment ability;\n(ii) feel they could achieve a better return on their money by investing it themselves than by making principal repayments on a home loan;23 and\n(iii) overestimate their future behaviour and self-control.

For example, if a consumer applies for a 30-year loan, with an interest-only period of 10 years, the assessment is based on principal-and-interest repayments over the residual term of 20 years.\n(b) The ‘full term’ method—The repayments are calculated on a principal-and-interest basis on the full term of the loan. For example, if a consumer applies for a 30-year loan with an interest-only period of 10 years, the assessment is based on principal-and-interest repayments over a 30-year period, even though the principal-and-interest period is only 20 years.","AKA":"ASIC445.Para247","Enacted":"2014-Sep-27","Regulator":"ASIC","Code":"ASIC445","CellSize":"100.000000000000","YearEnacted":"2014","SubHeading":"ASIC445"},{"Rank 2015":19.0,"Rank 2014":58.0,"Company":"ASIC445.Para248","Country":"Australia","Market value $m":"456 789,3","Heading":"ASIC445","Turnover $m":"724 773,1","Net income $m":"123 456,7","Total assets $m":"724 773,1","Employees":"12 365","Price $":"123,4","Year End":"2014-09-27","Level1":"ASIC445","RegID":"ASIC445.Para248","Description":"Calculating the repayments using the full-term method means that the repayments used for assessment are lower than those calculated using the residual-term method.
